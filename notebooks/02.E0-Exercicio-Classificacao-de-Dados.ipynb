    "Nesta lista de exercícios, você explorará a aplicação de métodos de aprendizado de máquina para realizar tarefas de classificação de dados. Você usará a base de dados [Food choices: College students' food and cooking preferences](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borapajo/food-choices?select=food_coded.csv) e avaliará vários algoritmos de classificação para determinar sua eficácia. O objetivo é entender como diferentes métodos de aprendizado de máquina se comportam em relação à acurácia na classificação de dados.\n",
    "\n",
    "O exercício será dividido em várias etapas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pré-processamento dos dados:**\n",
    "   - Descreva brevemente o conjunto de dados   \n",
    "   - Limpe o conjunto de dados, tratando valores ausentes, removendo duplicatas e realizando transformações necessárias. \n",
    "   - Caso você use os dados pré-processados na lista anterior, faça um breve descritivo dos principais ajustes.\n",
    "   - Codifique variáveis categóricas, se necessário, para que possam ser utilizadas em algoritmos de aprendizado de máquina.\n",
    "   - Cria a coluna `self_perception_overweight` com valor: `True` se a coluna `self_perception_weight` tem valor 4 ou 5; e `False`, caso contrário.\n",
    "   - Remova a coluna `self_perception_weight` do conjunto de dados.\n",
    "2. **Divisão do conjunto de dados:**\n",
    "   - Divida o conjunto de dados em um conjunto de treinamento e um conjunto de teste para avaliar o desempenho dos algoritmos. \n",
    "   - O mesmo conjunto de teste deve ser usado por todos os algoritmos analizados e nenhum dado deste pode ser usado na fase de treinamento.\n",
    "   - O atributo alvo (*rótulo*) da classificação será o campo `self_perception_overweight`.   \n",
    "3. **Seleção de algoritmos de classificação:**\n",
    "   - Selecione uma variedade de algoritmos de aprendizado de máquina para testar na tarefa de classificação.   \n",
    "   - Sua seleção deve conter, no mínimo, os seguintes métodos: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (Linear/RBF), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron.\n",
    "   - Descreva brevemente como funciona cada algoritmo selecionado.\n",
    "4. **Treinamento e avaliação:**\n",
    "   - Treine os algoritmos de classificação usando todo o conjunto de treinamento. \n",
    "   - Avalie o desempenho de cada algoritmo no conjunto de teste usando métricas como acurácia, precisão, recall e F1-score.\n",
    "   - Repita a análise treinando os algoritmos com validação cruzada.\n",
    "   - Repita a análise realizando ajuste de hiperparâmetros.\n",
    "5. **Análise dos resultados:**\n",
    "   - Prepare um texto que descreva os resultados obtidos e faça uma análise crítica destes resultados.\n",
    "   - Compare o desempenho dos diferentes algoritmos e explique por que alguns apresentaram resultados mais adequados que outros.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Documente todas as etapas em um arquivo Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) que inclua as análises, o código e as justificativas. Lembre-se de que é fundamental justificar todas as decisões tomadas ao longo do processo e documentar as análises de forma clara e concisa. Este trabalho tem como objetivo proporcionar uma compreensão prática da seleção e avaliação de algoritmos de classificação em cenários de aprendizado supervisionado.\n",
